Notes on 12_03_22 version:

MW edited MapsAnalysis code to change order of iamge processing, so that min and max cutoff vlauesa re applied FIRST, before low thresold fracitonal cutoff is applied. This more intuitive.

Note that alternte version (e.g., 'MapsAnalysis...._gridmpaps' generates maps images with grid overlaid for visual references.
Also a version of Maps Analysis that does autoarchinving of maps as well as rotation of maps.

Also, Dec 2022, modified Behav analysis so it Extracts sniff traces in a single 3D array and also generates STAs per each ROI in a single array.
Note still need to copy in latest file for loading files that TCR modified to read in new TSM files... 

June 2023:

ImageAnalysis:
MW modified how reading existing .align files works - uses existing idx vals in case not the whole file was used for alignment.

BatchProcessing: MW modified cases for doing alignment, alllowing to specify start frame to use for alignment.

Aug 2023 updates:

- added 'Merge ROIs' button to ImageAnalysis, which merges all selected ROIs into a single, new, ROI.

- 'loadScanData' updated to show scanbox info in the Info box.
